# FitUITableViewCellHeight
When We use many UI in UITableViewCell,How to fit the Cell height,I think that is a traditional problem.

The project imitate wechat friend circle(微信朋友圈).

In The XHMJ_FooterMarkCommonCell.xib,There is some skill about AutoLayout Usage,it will tell you how to use autolayout better,you
can make full use of the UI priority make the cell perfect and make the cell height is better.

There is a UITableView in the UITableViewCell.

Update!!!
I update a Controller that can explain the status of the CustomCell,and I use a height NSCache to store every cell height;
